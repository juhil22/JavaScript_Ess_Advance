    What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a popular format for storing and exchanging data.
It's designed to be both human-readable and machine-parsable. 
JSON is widely used in web development, data interchange, and configuration files.
Key Characteristics:

Text-based: JSON data is represented as text.
Data Format: It follows a specific structure to organize information.
Language-Independent: While it originated from JavaScript, JSON is used by many programming languages.
Simple Syntax: It's easy to learn and understand. 
Basic Structure:

JSON data consists of:

Objects: Enclosed in curly braces ({}), objects contain key-value pairs.
Arrays: Enclosed in square brackets ([]), arrays store an ordered list of values.
Values: Values can be strings, numbers, booleans (true or false), null, objects, or arrays.
Example:

JSON
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hobbies": ["reading", "coding", "hiking"]
}
Use code with caution.

Why is JSON Popular?

Readability: Its clear and concise syntax makes it easy for humans to understand. 
Efficiency: It's lightweight and efficient for data transmission.
Versatility: It can be used for various data structures and applications. 
Language Support: Most programming languages have built-in support for working with JSON. 
Common Use Cases:

Web APIs: Exchanging data between servers and clients. 
Configuration Files: Storing application settings.
Data Storage: Storing structured data in files.
Data Interchange: Transferring data between different systems.

    Promises in JavaScript

A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It's a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured and manageable way compared to traditional callback functions. Â  

Key Concepts:

States of a Promise:

Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: Operation completed successfully.
Rejected: Operation failed.
Resolving and Rejecting a Promise:

Resolve: The promise is fulfilled with a value.
Reject: The promise is rejected with an error reason.
Handling Promises:

then() method: Used to handle both fulfillment and rejection cases.
catch() method: Specifically handles rejection cases.
<script>
    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const randomNum = Math.random();
    if (randomNum > 0.5) {
      resolve("Promise fulfilled successfully!");
    } else {
      reject("Promise rejected!");
    }
  }, 2000);
});

myPromise
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
</script>
